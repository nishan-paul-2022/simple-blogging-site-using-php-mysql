(1, 1, 'nishan', 'nishan@gmail.com', 1, 'Book', 'Book Review of Da Vinci Code', 'A murder in Paris\' Louvre Museum and cryptic clues in some of Leonardo da Vinci\'s most famous paintings lead to the discovery of a religious mystery.', '&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy thriller, it can be argued, is the purest kind of bestseller. The premise of such books is that there\'s no such thing as a random happening; meanwhile, though bestsellers aren\'t exactly conspiracies, most huge publishing successes can be traced back to a web of connected events, so that form and content collide to an unusual degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Peter Benchley\'s Jaws was probably a good enough story to find readers at any time, but became a mid-70s sensation because the implications of the plot - horrible, sudden death in a holiday resort - reflected the neuroses of an affluent American generation enduring both a cold war and an oil war. Helen Fielding spotted that young unmarrieds were a social grouping without a literature; Allison Pearson noticed the same gap for working mums. And coming up to two years after September 11, 2001 - roughly the time it takes conventional fiction publishing to respond to cultural shifts - what did we find unstoppably atop the American fiction charts? Dan Brown\'s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/the-da-vinci-code&quot;&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/a&gt;, 450 pages of irritatingly gripping tosh, offers terrified and vengeful Americans a hidden pattern in the world\'s confusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When bad things happen, Brown reassures us, it is probably because of the machinations of a 1,000-year-old secret society which is quietly running the world, though often in conflict with another hidden organisation. There are probably a couple of verses in Nostradamus predicting the triumph of The Da Vinci Code: &quot;As the painted French woman smiles/The Brown man will top the heap&quot;, or something similar. Certainly, the novel\'s success can be attributed to those who read Nostradamus and believe that the smoke from the blazing twin towers formed the face of the devil or Osama bin Laden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens in The Da Vinci Code is ... alert readers will have noticed a delay in getting round to plot summary, but it takes time to force the face straight. Anyway, my lips are now level, so let\'s go. Art expert Jacques Sauniere is discovered murdered in the Louvre, having somehow found the strength in his last haemorrhaging moments to arrange his body in the shape of a famous artwork and leave a series of codes around the building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These altruistic clues are interpreted by Robert Langdon, an American &quot;professor of religious symbology&quot; who, by chance, is visiting Paris, and Sophie Neveu, a French &quot;cryptologist&quot; who is the granddaughter of the artistic cadaver in the Louvre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they joust with authorial research - about the divine proportion in nature and the possibility that the Mona Lisa is a painting of Leonardo himself in drag - a thug from the secretive Catholic organisation Opus Dei, under orders from a sinister bishop, is also trying to understand the meaning of the imaginative corpse in the museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all seems to be connected with the Priory of Sion, a secret society. Reading a book of this kind is rather like going to the doctor for the results of tests. You desperately want to know the outcome but have a sickening feeling about what it might prove to be. In this case, the answer was as bad as I\'d feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, crime and thriller fiction has been increasingly easy to defend against literary snobs at the level of the sentence. Not here. Brown keeps lugging in nuggets from his library: &quot;Nowadays, few people realised that the four-year schedule of modern Olympic Games still followed the cycles of Venus.&quot; Otherwise, he favours clunking, one-line plot-quickeners: &quot;Andorra, he thought, feeling his muscles tighten.&quot; French characters speak in American, while occasionally throwing in a &quot;prÃ©cisement&quot; to flap their passport at us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criticism won\'t hurt Brown, who can probably now buy an island with his royalties and a second one with the film rights. The author has, though, recently found himself on the end of an unwanted conspiracy theory: another writer has accused him of plagiarism. In strongly denying this, Brown employed a striking defence: that the points of overlap were clichÃ©s which were part of the genre of the thriller and therefore belonged to no one writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This admission of unoriginality may further anger readers and writers annoyed by seeing something as preposterous and sloppy (one terrible howler involves the European passport system) as The Da Vinci Code on its way to selling millions. But the success of this book is due not to the writing but to post-9/11 therapy. It tells so many Americans what they want to hear: that everything is meant. In doing so, Brown has cracked the bestseller code.&lt;/p&gt;', '2019-08-23 02:06:58', '2019-08-24 08:35:38'),
(2, 1, 'nishan', 'nishan@gmail.com', 2, 'Movie', 'Movie Review: The Dark Knight', 'Directed by Christopher Nolan | Rated PG-13  runtime: 152 minutes | released: July 16, 2008', '&lt;p&gt;â€œ&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/batman-1989&quot;&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt;â€ isnâ€™t a comic book anymore. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/christopher-nolan&quot;&gt;Christopher Nolan&lt;/a&gt;â€™s â€œThe Dark Knightâ€ is a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. It creates characters we come to care about. Thatâ€™s because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of the entire production. This film, and to a lesser degree â€œ&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/iron-man-2008&quot;&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;,â€ redefine the possibilities of the â€œcomic-book movie.â€&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€œThe Dark Knightâ€ is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. Heâ€™s a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key performance in the movie is by the late &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/heath-ledger&quot;&gt;Heath Ledger&lt;/a&gt;, as the Joker. Will he become the first posthumous Oscar winner since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/peter-finch&quot;&gt;Peter Finch&lt;/a&gt;? His Joker draws power from the actual inspiration of the character in the silent classic â€œ&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928&quot;&gt;The Man Who Laughs&lt;/a&gt;â€ (1928). His clown\'s makeup more sloppy than before, his cackle betraying deep wounds, he seeks revenge, he claims, for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. In one diabolical scheme near the end of the film, he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. Throughout the film, he devises ingenious situations that force Batman (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/christian-bale&quot;&gt;Christian Bale&lt;/a&gt;), Commissioner Gordon (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gary-oldman&quot;&gt;Gary Oldman&lt;/a&gt;) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/aaron-eckhart&quot;&gt;Aaron Eckhart&lt;/a&gt;) to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these actors and others are so powerful, and because the movie does not allow its spectacular special effects to upstage the humans, weâ€™re surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eckhart does an especially good job as Harvey Dent, whose character is transformed by a horrible fate into a bitter monster. It is customary in a comic book movie to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. â€œThe Dark Knightâ€ slips around those defenses and engages us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, the special effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate chase scenes. The movie was shot on location in Chicago, but it avoids such familiar landmarks as Marina City, the Wrigley Building or the skyline. Chicagoans will recognize many places, notably La Salle Street and Lower Wacker Drive, but director Nolan is not making a travelogue. He presents the city as a wilderness of skyscrapers, and a key sequence is set in the still-uncompleted Trump Tower. Through these heights, the Batman moves at the end of strong wires, or sometimes actually flies, using his cape as a parasail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plot involves nothing more or less than the Jokerâ€™s attempts to humiliate the forces for good and expose Batmanâ€™ secret identity, showing him to be a poser and a fraud. He includes Gordon and Dent on his target list, and contrives cruel tricks to play with the fact that Bruce Wayne once loved, and Harvey Dent now loves, Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/maggie-gyllenhaal&quot;&gt;Maggie Gyllenhaal&lt;/a&gt;). The tricks are more cruel than he realizes, because the Joker doesnâ€™t know Batmanâ€™s identity. Heath Ledger has a good deal of dialogue in the movie, and a lot of it isnâ€™t the usual jabs and jests weâ€™re familiar with: Itâ€™s psychologically more complex, outlining the dilemmas he has constructed, and explaining his reasons for them. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who first worked together on â€œ&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/memento-2001&quot;&gt;Memento&lt;/a&gt;â€) has more depth and poetry than we might have expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the supporting characters are crucial to the action, and are played effortlessly by the great actors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/morgan-freeman&quot;&gt;Morgan Freeman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michael-caine&quot;&gt;Michael Caine&lt;/a&gt;. Freeman, as the scientific genius Lucius Fox, is in charge of Bruce Wayneâ€™s underground headquarters, and makes an ethical objection to a method of eavesdropping on all of the citizens of Gotham City. His stand has current political implications. Caine is the faithful butler Alfred, who understands Wayne better than anybody, and makes a decision about a crucial letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolan also directed the previous, and excellent, â€œ&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/batman-begins-2005&quot;&gt;Batman Begins&lt;/a&gt;â€ (2005), which went into greater detail than ever before about Bruce Wayneâ€™s origins and the reasons for his compulsions. Now it is the Jokerâ€™s turn, although his past is handled entirely with dialogue, not flashbacks. There are no references to Batmanâ€™s childhood, but we certainly remember it, and we realize that this conflict is between two adults who were twisted by childhood cruelty â€” one compensating by trying to do good, the other by trying to do evil. Perhaps they instinctively understand that themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something fundamental seems to be happening in the upper realms of the comic-book movie. â€œSpider-Man IIâ€ (2004) may have defined the high point of the traditional film based on comic-book heroes. A movie like the new â€œHellboy IIâ€ allows its director free rein for his fantastical visions. But now â€œIron Manâ€ and even more so â€œThe Dark Knightâ€ move the genre into deeper waters. They realize, as some comic-book readers instinctively do, that these stories touch on deep fears, traumas, fantasies and hopes. And the Batman legend, with its origins in film noir, is the most fruitful one for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his two Batman movies, Nolan has freed the character to be a canvas for a broader scope of human emotion. For Bruce Wayne is a deeply troubled man, let there be no doubt, and if ever in exile from his heroic role, it would not surprise me what he finds himself capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;', '2019-08-23 02:15:11', '2019-08-23 02:15:11'),
(3, 2, 'ayan', 'ayan@gmail.com', 2, 'Movie', 'Movie Review of Arjun Reddy', 'Rating: 4/5 | Director: Sandeep Reddy Vanga | Actor: Vijay Deverakonda', '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjun Reddy Story:&lt;/strong&gt; A brilliant medico whoâ€™s the topper of his class has anger management issues. What happens when he loses control of his life due to an unforeseen incident? Does he get a chance at redemption?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjun Reddy Review: &lt;/strong&gt;Arjun Reddy (Vijay Deverakonda) is a vintage Bullet-riding, football-playing, angry, young final year medico who believes his actions are always justified. Preeti (Shalini Pandey), a first year student, walks into his life and it is love at first sight for the protagonist. She is a stark contrast to everything he is and at first, it seems like he bullies her into spending time with him. But time passes, love blossoms, passion roars, and nowhere does his fire lessen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But things change; circumstances force Arjun away from his love and he seems to hit rock bottom with a force thatâ€™s surprising, yet expected. He turns into a modern day Devadas, complete with a dog by his side. From a brilliant young man whose only issue was his anger, he turns into a raging alcoholic who smokes pot during his downtime and does coke whenever it gets too much. Despite all this, he continues to practice as a surgeon at a hospital till life threatens to throw him on his back again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thereâ€™s one dialogue in the movie that perfectly sums up the character of Arjun Reddy. Priyadarshi, who plays a cameo in the film, calls Arjun a â€˜free spirited individual in a democratic worldâ€™. Thereâ€™s nothing more apt than that to describe a character that you would both love and fear if you met him in real life. With â€˜Arjun Reddyâ€™, Sandeep Vanga has managed to tell a story that is seldom told, without sleaze or cheesy lines or OTT drama.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The protagonists of this film refreshingly refuse to confirm. All things scandalous to the world become but a way of life for Arjun. He questions the righteous middle class morality that society keeps throwing at his face, and lives his life without giving a damn. Even while turning to drugs, alcohol and casual sex, thereâ€™s an I-donâ€™t-give-an-eff attitude about Arjun. For him, these are just means to an end -- an escape from his heartache. The writing is so real, the acting so raw that you forget Arjun Reddy is a character played by Vijay Deverakonda. You feel this the most when in a key scene before the interval you face a heartbroken Arjun Reddy and realise you too are left with a broken heart and lump in your throat as well. After a light-hearted film like â€˜Pelli Choopuluâ€™, Vijay Deverakonda has proven heâ€™s more than just a pretty face, by carrying off a character as complex as this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preeti, on the other hand, starts out as a timid student you believe is being bullied and transforms into a woman whoâ€™s right in her convictions and strong enough to stand by them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Vijay Deverakonda is hands down the star of the show, and Preeti manages to come a close second, it is the character of Arjunâ€™s friend Shiva (Rahul) that deserves a special mention. He manages to be the sunshine in a world that keeps getting darker for Arjun. Kanchana who plays his grandmother in the film pulled off the role with beautiful ease too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dialogues, characters, instances in the film are so raw and realistic, one almost does not mind the long run time that drags in the second half. What also deserve a special mention are the beautiful songs, with music director Radhan doing a brilliant job of them. â€˜Arjun Reddyâ€™ is simply put, the dawn of a new era of films for the Telugu film industry.&lt;/p&gt;', '2019-08-23 02:32:08', '2019-08-23 02:32:08'),

This article is an example to help understand that style.', '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive programming&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_sport&quot;&gt;mind sport&lt;/a&gt; usually held over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet&quot;&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_network&quot;&gt;local network&lt;/a&gt;, involving participants trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming&quot;&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers. Competitive programming is recognized and supported by several multinational software and Internet companies, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; There are several organizations who host programming competitions on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/%D0%AF%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC.jpg/220px-%D0%AF%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/%D0%AF%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC.jpg/330px-%D0%AF%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/%D0%AF%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC.jpg/440px-%D0%AF%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC.jpg 2x&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Open championship on programming &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex&quot;&gt;Yandex.Algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, August 22, 2013.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A programming competition generally involves the host presenting a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic&quot;&gt;logical&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics&quot;&gt;mathematical&lt;/a&gt; problems to the contestants (who can vary in number from tens to several thousands), and contestants are required to write &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program&quot;&gt;computer programs&lt;/a&gt; capable of solving each problem. Judging is based mostly upon number of problems solved and time spent for writing successful solutions, but may also include other factors (quality of output produced, execution time, program size, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest contests known is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest&quot;&gt;ICPC&lt;/a&gt; which originated in the 1970s, and has grown to include 88 countries in its 2011 edition. Interest in competitive programming has grown extensively[&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;quantify&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] since 2000, and is strongly connected to the growth of the Internet, which facilitates holding international contests online, eliminating geographical problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of competitive programming is to write &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; of computer programs which are able to solve given problems. A vast majority of problems appearing in programming contests are mathematical or logical in nature. Typical such tasks belong to one of the following categories: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics&quot;&gt;combinatorics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory&quot;&gt;number theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory&quot;&gt;graph theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry&quot;&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;string analysis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure&quot;&gt;data structures&lt;/a&gt;. Problems related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence&quot;&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; are also popular in certain competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of the problem category, the process of solving a problem can be divided into two broad steps: constructing an efficient &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm&quot;&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, and implementing the algorithm in a suitable &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language&quot;&gt;programming language&lt;/a&gt; (the set of programming languages allowed varies from contest to contest). These are the two most commonly tested skills in programming competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most contests, the judging is done automatically by host machines, commonly known as judges. Every solution submitted by a contestant is run on the judge against a set of (usually secret) test cases. Normally, contest problems have an all-or-none marking system, meaning that a solution is &quot;Accepted&quot; only if it produces satisfactory results on all test cases run by the judge, and rejected otherwise. However, some contest problems may allow for partial scoring, depending on the number of test cases passed, the quality of the results, or some other specified criteria. Some other contests only require that the contestant submit the output corresponding to given input data, in which case the judge only has to analyze the submitted output data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online judges are online environments in which testing takes place. Online judges have ranklists showing users with the biggest number of accepted solutions and/or shortest execution time for a particular problem.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Notable competitions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of competition formats: short-term and long-term. Each round of short-term competition lasts from 1 to 3 hours. Long-term competitions can last from a few days to a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-term&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest&quot;&gt;ICPC&lt;/a&gt; - one of the oldest competitions, for students of universities in groups of 3 persons each&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Computer_Science_League&quot;&gt;ACSL&lt;/a&gt; - computer science competition with written and programming portions, for middle/high school students&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Code_Jam&quot;&gt;Google Code Jam&lt;/a&gt; - competition held from 2003, provided and sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Hacker_Cup&quot;&gt;Facebook Hacker Cup&lt;/a&gt; - competition held from 2011, provided and sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackerRank&quot;&gt;HackerRank&lt;/a&gt; Ad Infinitum&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; - Math Programming Contest by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackerRank&quot;&gt;HackerRank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeChef&quot;&gt;CodeChef&lt;/a&gt; Cook-Off&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-codechef.com-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; - an ACM-ICPC style programming contest held on second last Sunday of every month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LeetCode&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot;&gt;LeetCode&lt;/a&gt; Weekly Contest&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-leetcode.com-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; - a weekly programming contest consist of algorithmic questions from top companies from US and all over the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeChef&quot;&gt;CodeChef&lt;/a&gt; LunchTime&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-codechef.com-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; - a Junior Programming series held on last Sunday of every month, for middle/high school students&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeChef&quot;&gt;CodeChef&lt;/a&gt; SnackDown&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt; - An annual multi round global programming contest held by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeChef&quot;&gt;CodeChef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeforces&quot;&gt;Codeforces&lt;/a&gt; Round&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; - typically two hour contest held every week since 2010 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeforces&quot;&gt;Codeforces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEEXtreme_Programming_Competition&quot;&gt;IEEEXtreme Programming Competition&lt;/a&gt; - annual competition for IEEE Student Members held since 2006 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE&quot;&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics&quot;&gt;IOI&lt;/a&gt; - one of the oldest competitions, for secondary school students&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topcoder_Open&quot;&gt;Topcoder Open (TCO)&lt;/a&gt; - Algorithm - competition held since 2004 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topcoder&quot;&gt;Topcoder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex&quot;&gt;Yandex&lt;/a&gt; Algorithm - competition held since 2013 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex&quot;&gt;Yandex&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Olympiad_in_Informatics&quot;&gt;National Olympiad in Informatics&lt;/a&gt;, China - competition held in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; since 1984&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most of the above competitions, since the number of contestants is quite large, competitions are usually organized in several rounds.

The top performers at IOI and ACM-ICPC receive gold, silver and bronze medals while in the other contests, cash prizes are awarded to the top finishers. Also hitting the top places in the score tables of such competitions may attract interest of recruiters from software and Internet companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeChef&quot;&gt;CodeChef&lt;/a&gt; Long Challenges&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-codechef.com-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackerRank&quot;&gt;HackerRank&lt;/a&gt; Week of Code&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; â€“ 7-day contest by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackerRank&quot;&gt;HackerRank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICFP_Programming_Contest&quot;&gt;ICFP Programming Contest&lt;/a&gt; â€“ annual 3-day competition held since 1998 by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Functional_Programming&quot;&gt;International Conference on Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topcoder&quot;&gt;Topcoder&lt;/a&gt; Marathon Matches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial intelligence and machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle&quot;&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt; â€“ machine learning competitions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CodeCup â€“ AI board game competition held annually since 2003.

It can help you turn it into reality today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Handyman&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you always fixing things around the house? Often on call when friends need small projects completed? Put together a website, figure out what your time and expertise is worth, and start asking those thankful friends for referrals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Woodworker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you have a passion for crafting beautiful furniture or other home goods out of wood -- thereâ€™s demand for that. List a few of your pieces on sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/&quot;&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfbay.craigslist.org/&quot;&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt;. Once you build a following, consider starting a website, accepting custom orders, or expanding to refinishing work and upholstery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Online dating consultant&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dating consultants usually charge for their time. They help people create successful online dating profiles, source possible matches from outside normal online channels, and offer a level of personalization Tinder just canâ€™t. Think youâ€™ve got a knack for the match? This might be the business for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Sewing and alteration specialist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People will always need clothing hemmed and buttons mended -- and you could be the person to do it. If you love sewing, start by offering simple services like those mentioned above, and expand your repertoire to dressmaking and design as you build a customer base and demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Freelance developer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From building websites for other small businesses to providing technical support for certain projects, quality web development is in high demand right now. With such a technical skillset, make sure you can describe what you do and how you will do it in easy-to-understand language. Test your messaging on friends and family who donâ€™t have a firm understanding of the work you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Personal trainer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offer in-home consultations, personalized nutrition and exercise regimens, and community boot camps to get the word out. Donâ€™t forget to populate an Instagram feed with inspirational quotes, free exercise videos, and yummy snack ideas as well -- itâ€™s a common way for fitness gurus to build their brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Freelance graphic designer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set your own hours, choose your projects, and build a portfolio and business youâ€™re proud of. From website design to blog graphics and more, many companies seek out experienced graphic designers for all manner of projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Life/career coach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have some experience under your belt, put it to good use as a life or career coach. Many of us are looking for guidance in our careers -- and finding someone with the time to mentor us can be tough. Life/career coaches donâ€™t come cheap, but they are able to offer clients the intense and hands-on training and advice they need to make serious moves in their personal and professional lives. After all, sometimes everyone just needs some &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/motivational-quotes-from-some-of-the-world-most-successful-entrepreneurs&quot;&gt;uplifting advice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Resume writer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submitting a resume, cover letter, and -- when necessary -- portfolio for a new job can be tough and time consuming. Thatâ€™s why many people hire help. Assist clients with tailored resumes, beautifully edited cover letters, and carefully crafted portfolios that make it impossible for employers to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Freelance writer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have writing skills, thereâ€™s someone out there willing to pay you for them. Write blog posts, magazine articles, and website copy galore -- just make sure you have a body of work built up to share with potential clients. Even if you create a few sample pieces to have on hand, theyâ€™ll help exhibit your work and attract new business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Translator&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speak a foreign language? Start a translation service. Consider specializing in a specific genre of translation, like medical or financial translation, as you might be able to fill a niche need in your community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Garden designer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have the willingness to do the dirty work in their backyards, but few have the know-how to design a backyard space to begin with. Draw up the designs for your clientsâ€™ outdoor spaces and let them do the actual digging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;13. Ecommerce store owner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you create, collect, or curate anything special? Consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/blog/14459769-ecommerce-business-blueprint-how-to-build-launch-and-grow-a-profitable-online-store&quot;&gt;starting an ecommerce store&lt;/a&gt; and turning your hobby into a full-time job. Whether you need somewhere to sell all that pottery youâ€™ve been making, or an excuse to search for the sports memorabilia you love tracking down -- an ecommerce store can make it financially viable for you to pursue your passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;14. Landscaper&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mowing, tree-trimming, and seasonal decor are all neighborhood needs. If you have or can acquire the equipment, a landscaping business can be a lucrative affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;15. Videographer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video production requires you to have invested in the equipment up front which can be quite expensive. But thatâ€™s also what makes your services so valuable. Make sure you have a reel of your work to share or create a website with several selections of your work available for interested viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;16. Photographer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by conducting photo shoots for your family and friends. As you build a body of work, ask for referrals. Photography businesses often grow by word of mouth, so create a Facebook page where you can tag recent clients, which will show up in their friendsâ€™ newsfeeds as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;17. Travel planner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time of the travel agent might be passing, but people are still looking for those with a knack for more nontraditional travel coordination. If you always plan the perfect vacations complete with beautiful hotels, the ideal location, and a bevy of delicious restaurants lined up for every evening, consider advertising your services as a more modern approach to travel planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;18. Car-detailing specialist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devil is in the details and you can be too. Car detailing services that travel to the client are in high demand. Just make sure you have the flexibility, transportation, and equipment to take your business on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;19. Home inspector&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will require a great deal of expertise and certification, but itâ€™s a job that can give you the flexibility and pay youâ€™ve always dreamed of. Confirm the licensing requirements in your state and consider taking a few courses to build out your knowledge, authority, and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;20. House cleaner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a low barrier to entry, house cleaning can be a great way to start doing what you love -- soon. Consider advertising to homes in your neighborhood and get more bang for your buck by earning a few small businesses as clients as well. Theyâ€™ll usually bring in a higher paycheck for a similar amount of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;21. Personal chef&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all love to eat, but few of us have the time or energy to cook healthy, delicious meals. Advertise your services to local families and businesses alike. And consider &quot;chunking&quot; certain groups of clients -- say, vegetarians -- so you can cook larger quantities of the same dish to feed them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;22. Property manager&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people maintain properties they donâ€™t live in -- often based in different cities or states. Itâ€™s helpful to have someone to ensure the property is being well taken care of, handle small fixes as they arise, and serve as a liaison to renters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;23. Packing services facilitator&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving is always a pain, and many people hire the entire packing process out. Want to have a steady stream of clients? Partner with a local moving service who will refer new clients to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;24. Massage therapist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soothe aching muscles and promote peace for your clients as a massage therapist. Look into training and certification courses in your city and state and invest in a portable bed to take on client visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;25. Hairdressing or makeup artist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, you could go to cosmetology school and pay for an expensive chair at a salon, or you could offer specialized styling and makeup services right to your clientâ€™s door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;26. Bed and breakfast owner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another business venture that will require you to research the correct licensure from your state, but it will be well worth it to see your dreams come true. Consider what guests will be traveling to your area to experience and create special packages and themed stays to coincide with their interests in your locale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;27. Interior designer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to landscape design -- there are many people who have the ability to buy the furniture and home decor they need to fill their rooms, but few who know where to start. It might take some time to build a portfolio but documenting your projects and sharing them online can build a fan base beyond your wildest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;28. Nonprofit owner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you dream of devoting your life to a cause you believe in, it might be time to start a nonprofit. Youâ€™ll need to incorporate your business and file for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status -- and then youâ€™ll be required to meet ongoing standards of compliance, but the payoff is making a meaningful impact on a cause you believe in. Want to do good while still making a profit? Consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/social-entrepreneurship&quot;&gt;social entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;29. Tour guide&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love the local history of your city or state? Consider becoming a tour guide. Sure, youâ€™ll need to conduct tons of research to be able to do the job well, but thatâ€™s half the fun. Set yourself apart by offering tours that speak to a specific niche of your communityâ€™s history. Some tour guides offer historical walking tours of their townâ€™s most haunted spots while others curate guided foodie tours for guests to get a true taste of the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;30. Tutor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether math whiz, piano master, or Shakespeare aficionado -- thereâ€™s someone out there who needs a little help and is willing to pay for it. Advertise your services through local schools, community colleges, and community centers to get the word out and build a customer base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;31. Consultant&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have significant experience in or knowledge of a specific subject, consider becoming a consultant. Perhaps youâ€™re an expert at hiring practices, have a knack for SEO, or have led multiple sales teams to six-figure success. If youâ€™re good at it, market yourself as a consultant and charge the going rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;32. Clothing boutique owner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you dream of building your own fashion empire, why not start with a local boutique? Build buzz with impressive window displays, inspiring social media accounts, and heavy community involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;33. Event planner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might choose to specialize in a specific type of event -- like weddings or company meetings -- or set yourself up as an event planner of all trades. If youâ€™re highly organized, pay keen attention to minute details, and have experience planning large events, it might be time others benefit from your skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;34. Specialty food store owner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gourmet foods, cheeses, sake, wine -- you name a food, thereâ€™s a specialty food store out there for it. Put your passion for exotic olive oils to good use and open a store where you offer the kind of expertise and selection your audience couldnâ€™t dream of getting from their local grocer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;35. Personal assistant&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, if youâ€™re an organized, highly detailed person, the life of a personal assistant might be for you. Donâ€™t want to be tied to one office or person all day, every day? Consider becoming a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/email-templates-virtual-assistant&quot;&gt;virtual assistant&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you a more flexible work environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;36. Food truck owner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always dreamt of owning a restaurant but not quite ready to take the plunge? Test out your concepts with a food truck. Itâ€™s a great way to become familiar with food and restaurant licensing in your state, see what people like and donâ€™t like, and build a ravenous following before ever opening or investing in a brick-and-mortar location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;37. Consignment shop owner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have an eye for style but donâ€™t want to invest in the inventory of a brand-new boutique, consider going consignment. It will allow you to curate a collection of clothing that matches your goals and aesthetic, without the overhead of a boutique selling entirely new garments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;38. Caterer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that personal chef gig is too restrictive for your schedule, consider catering instead. Pick your projects, work fewer but larger events, and get really good at time management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;39. Gym owner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kickboxing gyms, yoga studios, CrossFit, oh my! Turn your passion for fitness into a community for others by opening your own gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;40. Daycare owner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childcare continues to be in high demand. While nannies and nanny shares are popular right now, a good daycare is hard to find. Fill a need in your neighborhood by opening your own. And, as always, make sure youâ€™re complying with your city and stateâ€™s zoning, licensure, insurance, and inspection requirements.&lt;/p&gt;', '2019-08-24 02:42:25', '2019-08-25 00:10:59');

It creates characters we come to care about. Thatâ€™s because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of the entire production. This film, and to a lesser degree â€œ&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/iron-man-2008&quot;&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;,â€ redefine the possibilities of the â€œcomic-book movie.â€&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€œThe Dark Knightâ€ is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. Heâ€™s a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key performance in the movie is by the late &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/heath-ledger&quot;&gt;Heath Ledger&lt;/a&gt;, as the Joker. Will he become the first posthumous Oscar winner since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/peter-finch&quot;&gt;Peter Finch&lt;/a&gt;? His Joker draws power from the actual inspiration of the character in the silent classic â€œ&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928&quot;&gt;The Man Who Laughs&lt;/a&gt;â€ (1928). His clown\'s makeup more sloppy than before, his cackle betraying deep wounds, he seeks revenge, he claims, for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. In one diabolical scheme near the end of the film, he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. Throughout the film, he devises ingenious situations that force Batman (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/christian-bale&quot;&gt;Christian Bale&lt;/a&gt;), Commissioner Gordon (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gary-oldman&quot;&gt;Gary Oldman&lt;/a&gt;) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/aaron-eckhart&quot;&gt;Aaron Eckhart&lt;/a&gt;) to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these actors and others are so powerful, and because the movie does not allow its spectacular special effects to upstage the humans, weâ€™re surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eckhart does an especially good job as Harvey Dent, whose character is transformed by a horrible fate into a bitter monster. It is customary in a comic book movie to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. â€œThe Dark Knightâ€ slips around those defenses and engages us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, the special effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate chase scenes. The movie was shot on location in Chicago, but it avoids such familiar landmarks as Marina City, the Wrigley Building or the skyline. Chicagoans will recognize many places, notably La Salle Street and Lower Wacker Drive, but director Nolan is not making a travelogue. He presents the city as a wilderness of skyscrapers, and a key sequence is set in the still-uncompleted Trump Tower. Through these heights, the Batman moves at the end of strong wires, or sometimes actually flies, using his cape as a parasail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plot involves nothing more or less than the Jokerâ€™s attempts to humiliate the forces for good and expose Batmanâ€™ secret identity, showing him to be a poser and a fraud. He includes Gordon and Dent on his target list, and contrives cruel tricks to play with the fact that Bruce Wayne once loved, and Harvey Dent now loves, Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/maggie-gyllenhaal&quot;&gt;Maggie Gyllenhaal&lt;/a&gt;). The tricks are more cruel than he realizes, because the Joker doesnâ€™t know Batmanâ€™s identity. Heath Ledger has a good deal of dialogue in the movie, and a lot of it isnâ€™t the usual jabs and jests weâ€™re familiar with: Itâ€™s psychologically more complex, outlining the dilemmas he has constructed, and explaining his reasons for them. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who first worked together on â€œ&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/memento-2001&quot;&gt;Memento&lt;/a&gt;â€) has more depth and poetry than we might have expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the supporting characters are crucial to the action, and are played effortlessly by the great actors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/morgan-freeman&quot;&gt;Morgan Freeman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michael-caine&quot;&gt;Michael Caine&lt;/a&gt;. Freeman, as the scientific genius Lucius Fox, is in charge of Bruce Wayneâ€™s underground headquarters, and makes an ethical objection to a method of eavesdropping on all of the citizens of Gotham City. His stand has current political implications. Caine is the faithful butler Alfred, who understands Wayne better than anybody, and makes a decision about a crucial letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolan also directed the previous, and excellent, â€œ&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/batman-begins-2005&quot;&gt;Batman Begins&lt;/a&gt;â€ (2005), which went into greater detail than ever before about Bruce Wayneâ€™s origins and the reasons for his compulsions. Now it is the Jokerâ€™s turn, although his past is handled entirely with dialogue, not flashbacks. There are no references to Batmanâ€™s childhood, but we certainly remember it, and we realize that this conflict is between two adults who were twisted by childhood cruelty â€” one compensating by trying to do good, the other by trying to do evil. Perhaps they instinctively understand that themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something fundamental seems to be happening in the upper realms of the comic-book movie. â€œSpider-Man IIâ€ (2004) may have defined the high point of the traditional film based on comic-book heroes. A movie like the new â€œHellboy IIâ€ allows its director free rein for his fantastical visions. But now â€œIron Manâ€ and even more so â€œThe Dark Knightâ€ move the genre into deeper waters. They realize, as some comic-book readers instinctively do, that these stories touch on deep fears, traumas, fantasies and hopes. And the Batman legend, with its origins in film noir, is the most fruitful one for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his two Batman movies, Nolan has freed the character to be a canvas for a broader scope of human emotion. For Bruce Wayne is a deeply troubled man, let there be no doubt, and if ever in exile from his heroic role, it would not surprise me what he finds himself capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;', '2019-08-23 02:15:11', '2019-08-23 02:15:11'),

Caine is the faithful butler Alfred, who understands Wayne better than anybody, and makes a decision about a crucial letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolan also directed the previous, and excellent, â€œ&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/batman-begins-2005&quot;&gt;Batman Begins&lt;/a&gt;â€ (2005), which went into greater detail than ever before about Bruce Wayneâ€™s origins and the reasons for his compulsions. Now it is the Jokerâ€™s turn, although his past is handled entirely with dialogue, not flashbacks. There are no references to Batmanâ€™s childhood, but we certainly remember it, and we realize that this conflict is between two adults who were twisted by childhood cruelty â€” one compensating by trying to do good, the other by trying to do evil. Perhaps they instinctively understand that themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something fundamental seems to be happening in the upper realms of the comic-book movie. â€œSpider-Man IIâ€ (2004) may have defined the high point of the traditional film based on comic-book heroes. A movie like the new â€œHellboy IIâ€ allows its director free rein for his fantastical visions. But now â€œIron Manâ€ and even more so â€œThe Dark Knightâ€ move the genre into deeper waters. They realize, as some comic-book readers instinctively do, that these stories touch on deep fears, traumas, fantasies and hopes. And the Batman legend, with its origins in film noir, is the most fruitful one for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his two Batman movies, Nolan has freed the character to be a canvas for a broader scope of human emotion. For Bruce Wayne is a deeply troubled man, let there be no doubt, and if ever in exile from his heroic role, it would not surprise me what he finds himself capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;', '2019-08-23 02:15:11', '2019-08-23 02:15:11'),

What happens when he loses control of his life due to an unforeseen incident? Does he get a chance at redemption?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjun Reddy Review: &lt;/strong&gt;Arjun Reddy (Vijay Deverakonda) is a vintage Bullet-riding, football-playing, angry, young final year medico who believes his actions are always justified. Preeti (Shalini Pandey), a first year student, walks into his life and it is love at first sight for the protagonist. She is a stark contrast to everything he is and at first, it seems like he bullies her into spending time with him. But time passes, love blossoms, passion roars, and nowhere does his fire lessen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But things change; circumstances force Arjun away from his love and he seems to hit rock bottom with a force thatâ€™s surprising, yet expected. He turns into a modern day Devadas, complete with a dog by his side. From a brilliant young man whose only issue was his anger, he turns into a raging alcoholic who smokes pot during his downtime and does coke whenever it gets too much. Despite all this, he continues to practice as a surgeon at a hospital till life threatens to throw him on his back again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thereâ€™s one dialogue in the movie that perfectly sums up the character of Arjun Reddy. Priyadarshi, who plays a cameo in the film, calls Arjun a â€˜free spirited individual in a democratic worldâ€™. Thereâ€™s nothing more apt than that to describe a character that you would both love and fear if you met him in real life. With â€˜Arjun Reddyâ€™, Sandeep Vanga has managed to tell a story that is seldom told, without sleaze or cheesy lines or OTT drama.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The protagonists of this film refreshingly refuse to confirm. All things scandalous to the world become but a way of life for Arjun. He questions the righteous middle class morality that society keeps throwing at his face, and lives his life without giving a damn. Even while turning to drugs, alcohol and casual sex, thereâ€™s an I-donâ€™t-give-an-eff attitude about Arjun. For him, these are just means to an end -- an escape from his heartache. The writing is so real, the acting so raw that you forget Arjun Reddy is a character played by Vijay Deverakonda. You feel this the most when in a key scene before the interval you face a heartbroken Arjun Reddy and realise you too are left with a broken heart and lump in your throat as well. After a light-hearted film like â€˜Pelli Choopuluâ€™, Vijay Deverakonda has proven heâ€™s more than just a pretty face, by carrying off a character as complex as this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preeti, on the other hand, starts out as a timid student you believe is being bullied and transforms into a woman whoâ€™s right in her convictions and strong enough to stand by them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Vijay Deverakonda is hands down the star of the show, and Preeti manages to come a close second, it is the character of Arjunâ€™s friend Shiva (Rahul) that deserves a special mention. He manages to be the sunshine in a world that keeps getting darker for Arjun. Kanchana who plays his grandmother in the film pulled off the role with beautiful ease too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dialogues, characters, instances in the film are so raw and realistic, one almost does not mind the long run time that drags in the second half. What also deserve a special mention are the beautiful songs, with music director Radhan doing a brilliant job of them. â€˜Arjun Reddyâ€™ is simply put, the dawn of a new era of films for the Telugu film industry.&lt;/p&gt;', '2019-08-23 02:32:08', '2019-08-23 02:32:08'),

Judging is based mostly upon number of problems solved and time spent for writing successful solutions, but may also include other factors (quality of output produced, execution time, program size, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest contests known is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest&quot;&gt;ICPC&lt;/a&gt; which originated in the 1970s, and has grown to include 88 countries in its 2011 edition. Interest in competitive programming has grown extensively[&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;quantify&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] since 2000, and is strongly connected to the growth of the Internet, which facilitates holding international contests online, eliminating geographical problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of competitive programming is to write &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; of computer programs which are able to solve given problems. A vast majority of problems appearing in programming contests are mathematical or logical in nature. Typical such tasks belong to one of the following categories: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics&quot;&gt;combinatorics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory&quot;&gt;number theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory&quot;&gt;graph theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry&quot;&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;string analysis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure&quot;&gt;data structures&lt;/a&gt;. Problems related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence&quot;&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; are also popular in certain competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of the problem category, the process of solving a problem can be divided into two broad steps: constructing an efficient &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm&quot;&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, and implementing the algorithm in a suitable &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language&quot;&gt;programming language&lt;/a&gt; (the set of programming languages allowed varies from contest to contest). These are the two most commonly tested skills in programming competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most contests, the judging is done automatically by host machines, commonly known as judges. Every solution submitted by a contestant is run on the judge against a set of (usually secret) test cases. Normally, contest problems have an all-or-none marking system, meaning that a solution is &quot;Accepted&quot; only if it produces satisfactory results on all test cases run by the judge, and rejected otherwise. However, some contest problems may allow for partial scoring, depending on the number of test cases passed, the quality of the results, or some other specified criteria. Some other contests only require that the contestant submit the output corresponding to given input data, in which case the judge only has to analyze the submitted output data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online judges are online environments in which testing takes place. Online judges have ranklists showing users with the biggest number of accepted solutions and/or shortest execution time for a particular problem.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Notable competitions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of competition formats: short-term and long-term.

It can help you turn it into reality today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;1. Handyman&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Are you always fixing things around the house? Often on call when friends need small projects completed? Put together a website, figure out what your time and expertise is worth, and start asking those thankful friends for referrals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;2. Woodworker&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similarly, if you have a passion for crafting beautiful furniture or other home goods out of wood -- thereâ€™s demand for that. List a few of your pieces on sites like &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.etsy.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Etsy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.ebay.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;eBay&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, or &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://sfbay.craigslist.org/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Craigslist&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Once you build a following, consider starting a website, accepting custom orders, or expanding to refinishing work and upholstery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;3. Online dating consultant&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dating consultants usually charge for their time. They help people create successful online dating profiles, source possible matches from outside normal online channels, and offer a level of personalization Tinder just canâ€™t. Think youâ€™ve got a knack for the match? This might be the business for you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;4. Sewing and alteration specialist&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People will always need clothing hemmed and buttons mended -- and you could be the person to do it. If you love sewing, start by offering simple services like those mentioned above, and expand your repertoire to dressmaking and design as you build a customer base and demand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;5. Freelance developer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From building websites for other small businesses to providing technical support for certain projects, quality web development is in high demand right now. With such a technical skillset, make sure you can describe what you do and how you will do it in easy-to-understand language. Test your messaging on friends and family who donâ€™t have a firm understanding of the work you do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;6. Personal trainer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Offer in-home consultations, personalized nutrition and exercise regimens, and community boot camps to get the word out. Donâ€™t forget to populate an Instagram feed with inspirational quotes, free exercise videos, and yummy snack ideas as well -- itâ€™s a common way for fitness gurus to build their brands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;7. Freelance graphic designer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Set your own hours, choose your projects, and build a portfolio and business youâ€™re proud of. From website design to blog graphics and more, many companies seek out experienced graphic designers for all manner of projects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;8. Life/career coach&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have some experience under your belt, put it to good use as a life or career coach. Many of us are looking for guidance in our careers -- and finding someone with the time to mentor us can be tough. Life/career coaches donâ€™t come cheap, but they are able to offer clients the intense and hands-on training and advice they need to make serious moves in their personal and professional lives. After all, sometimes everyone just needs some &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/motivational-quotes-from-some-of-the-world-most-successful-entrepreneurs&amp;quot;&amp;gt;uplifting advice&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;9. Resume writer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Submitting a resume, cover letter, and -- when necessary -- portfolio for a new job can be tough and time consuming. Thatâ€™s why many people hire help. Assist clients with tailored resumes, beautifully edited cover letters, and carefully crafted portfolios that make it impossible for employers to ignore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;10. Freelance writer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have writing skills, thereâ€™s someone out there willing to pay you for them. Write blog posts, magazine articles, and website copy galore -- just make sure you have a body of work built up to share with potential clients. Even if you create a few sample pieces to have on hand, theyâ€™ll help exhibit your work and attract new business.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;11. Translator&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speak a foreign language? Start a translation service. Consider specializing in a specific genre of translation, like medical or financial translation, as you might be able to fill a niche need in your community.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;12. Garden designer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many people have the willingness to do the dirty work in their backyards, but few have the know-how to design a backyard space to begin with. Draw up the designs for your clientsâ€™ outdoor spaces and let them do the actual digging.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;13. Ecommerce store owner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you create, collect, or curate anything special? Consider &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.shopify.com/blog/14459769-ecommerce-business-blueprint-how-to-build-launch-and-grow-a-profitable-online-store&amp;quot;&amp;gt;starting an ecommerce store&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and turning your hobby into a full-time job. Whether you need somewhere to sell all that pottery youâ€™ve been making, or an excuse to search for the sports memorabilia you love tracking down -- an ecommerce store can make it financially viable for you to pursue your passion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;14. Landscaper&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mowing, tree-trimming, and seasonal decor are all neighborhood needs. If you have or can acquire the equipment, a landscaping business can be a lucrative affair.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;15. Videographer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Video production requires you to have invested in the equipment up front which can be quite expensive. But thatâ€™s also what makes your services so valuable. Make sure you have a reel of your work to share or create a website with several selections of your work available for interested viewers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;16. Photographer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Start by conducting photo shoots for your family and friends. As you build a body of work, ask for referrals. Photography businesses often grow by word of mouth, so create a Facebook page where you can tag recent clients, which will show up in their friendsâ€™ newsfeeds as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;17. Travel planner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The time of the travel agent might be passing, but people are still looking for those with a knack for more nontraditional travel coordination. If you always plan the perfect vacations complete with beautiful hotels, the ideal location, and a bevy of delicious restaurants lined up for every evening, consider advertising your services as a more modern approach to travel planning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;18. Car-detailing specialist&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The devil is in the details and you can be too. Car detailing services that travel to the client are in high demand. Just make sure you have the flexibility, transportation, and equipment to take your business on the road.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;19. Home inspector&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This will require a great deal of expertise and certification, but itâ€™s a job that can give you the flexibility and pay youâ€™ve always dreamed of. Confirm the licensing requirements in your state and consider taking a few courses to build out your knowledge, authority, and expertise.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;20. House cleaner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With a low barrier to entry, house cleaning can be a great way to start doing what you love -- soon. Consider advertising to homes in your neighborhood and get more bang for your buck by earning a few small businesses as clients as well. Theyâ€™ll usually bring in a higher paycheck for a similar amount of work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;21. Personal chef&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We all love to eat, but few of us have the time or energy to cook healthy, delicious meals. Advertise your services to local families and businesses alike. And consider &amp;quot;chunking&amp;quot; certain groups of clients -- say, vegetarians -- so you can cook larger quantities of the same dish to feed them all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;22. Property manager&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many people maintain properties they donâ€™t live in -- often based in different cities or states. Itâ€™s helpful to have someone to ensure the property is being well taken care of, handle small fixes as they arise, and serve as a liaison to renters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;23. Packing services facilitator&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moving is always a pain, and many people hire the entire packing process out. Want to have a steady stream of clients? Partner with a local moving service who will refer new clients to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;24. Massage therapist&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Soothe aching muscles and promote peace for your clients as a massage therapist. Look into training and certification courses in your city and state and invest in a portable bed to take on client visits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;25. Hairdressing or makeup artist&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure, you could go to cosmetology school and pay for an expensive chair at a salon, or you could offer specialized styling and makeup services right to your clientâ€™s door.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;26. Bed and breakfast owner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is another business venture that will require you to research the correct licensure from your state, but it will be well worth it to see your dreams come true. Consider what guests will be traveling to your area to experience and create special packages and themed stays to coincide with their interests in your locale.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;27. Interior designer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similar to landscape design -- there are many people who have the ability to buy the furniture and home decor they need to fill their rooms, but few who know where to start. It might take some time to build a portfolio but documenting your projects and sharing them online can build a fan base beyond your wildest dreams.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;28. Nonprofit owner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you dream of devoting your life to a cause you believe in, it might be time to start a nonprofit. Youâ€™ll need to incorporate your business and file for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status -- and then youâ€™ll be required to meet ongoing standards of compliance, but the payoff is making a meaningful impact on a cause you believe in. Want to do good while still making a profit? Consider &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/social-entrepreneurship&amp;quot;&amp;gt;social entrepreneurship&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;29. Tour guide&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Love the local history of your city or state? Consider becoming a tour guide. Sure, youâ€™ll need to conduct tons of research to be able to do the job well, but thatâ€™s half the fun. Set yourself apart by offering tours that speak to a specific niche of your communityâ€™s history. Some tour guides offer historical walking tours of their townâ€™s most haunted spots while others curate guided foodie tours for guests to get a true taste of the city.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;30. Tutor&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether math whiz, piano master, or Shakespeare aficionado -- thereâ€™s someone out there who needs a little help and is willing to pay for it. Advertise your services through local schools, community colleges, and community centers to get the word out and build a customer base.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;31. Consultant&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have significant experience in or knowledge of a specific subject, consider becoming a consultant. Perhaps youâ€™re an expert at hiring practices, have a knack for SEO, or have led multiple sales teams to six-figure success. If youâ€™re good at it, market yourself as a consultant and charge the going rate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;32. Clothing boutique owner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you dream of building your own fashion empire, why not start with a local boutique? Build buzz with impressive window displays, inspiring social media accounts, and heavy community involvement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;33. Event planner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You might choose to specialize in a specific type of event -- like weddings or company meetings -- or set yourself up as an event planner of all trades. If youâ€™re highly organized, pay keen attention to minute details, and have experience planning large events, it might be time others benefit from your skills.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;34. Specialty food store owner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gourmet foods, cheeses, sake, wine -- you name a food, thereâ€™s a specialty food store out there for it. Put your passion for exotic olive oils to good use and open a store where you offer the kind of expertise and selection your audience couldnâ€™t dream of getting from their local grocer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;35. Personal assistant&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Again, if youâ€™re an organized, highly detailed person, the life of a personal assistant might be for you. Donâ€™t want to be tied to one office or person all day, every day? Consider becoming a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/email-templates-virtual-assistant&amp;quot;&amp;gt;virtual assistant&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, which allows you a more flexible work environment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;36. Food truck owner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Always dreamt of owning a restaurant but not quite ready to take the plunge? Test out your concepts with a food truck. Itâ€™s a great way to become familiar with food and restaurant licensing in your state, see what people like and donâ€™t like, and build a ravenous following before ever opening or investing in a brick-and-mortar location.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;37. Consignment shop owner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have an eye for style but donâ€™t want to invest in the inventory of a brand-new boutique, consider going consignment. It will allow you to curate a collection of clothing that matches your goals and aesthetic, without the overhead of a boutique selling entirely new garments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;38. Caterer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If that personal chef gig is too restrictive for your schedule, consider catering instead. Pick your projects, work fewer but larger events, and get really good at time management.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;39. Gym owner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kickboxing gyms, yoga studios, CrossFit, oh my! Turn your passion for fitness into a community for others by opening your own gym.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;40. Daycare owner&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Childcare continues to be in high demand. While nannies and nanny shares are popular right now, a good daycare is hard to find. Fill a need in your neighborhood by opening your own. And, as always, make sure youâ€™re complying with your city and stateâ€™s zoning, licensure, insurance, and inspection requirements.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2019-08-24 02:42:25');
